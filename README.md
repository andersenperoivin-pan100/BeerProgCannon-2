BeerProgCannon-2
==============

BeerProgCannon 2 - a demo forked in to the same concept
-------------------------------------------------------

The game consists of a cannon at the bottom of the browser window, that rotates with mouse movement and shoots beers
when the mouse button is clicked (the cannon "loads" for a short time - it is not a machine gun).

Images of attendends of "pils og programmering" fly around in the sky. You need to provide them with beer as they are
o'rly so busy programming. They are thirsty help them out!

Change log:

0.1.1 Eoma implemented a gravity system making the beers turn and fall back down.

0.1 Added collision detection

0.0.2 Fixed bug with positioning. Cleaner code and separation between code, css and html.
2 Beers were given away for this to happen!

0.0.1 - experimental 1st commit with the cannon shooting beers.

Contributors: eoma and ljos. Both were given beers.

TODO: This is abandoned and I hope for better forks. FlowerProgCannon is a great idea!
The most important thing to do in a fun-programming-high-school session is to cooperate
with the other students and get feedback on how the next semester can be less frustrating.
